# Universal Studios Florida Playlists Catalog

A project aimed at documenting and preserving the music selection across the Universal parks.


# Why am I doing this?
  Working at Universal since 2018, I've heard the playlists everywhere across the parks countless times. When looking online for a collection of what plays where, I couldn't find a single thing. This project aims to document the songs played in each park by what location they play in. It's my first project and as of beginning, I only have New York as a complete playlist. A quick scope of what I plan to implement:

# Catalog of Playlists by Area
  Upon entering the catalog, I want to have card navigation. For example, you start by pressing the Universal Studios card (as opposed to the Islands of Adventure card later down the line). From there, cards representing the different areas will come up, for now being Production, Hollywood, New York, San Francisco, London, Diagon Alley, Expo, and Dreamworks. Upon selecting, there will be a main playlist for the area and some sub playlists, for example Lombardi's Seafood in San Francisco. Each song will be in the order played, with an arbitrary starting point.

# Global Search Bar
  In addition to finding individual songs and areas, I want to be able to search for artists and maybe even genres down the line.

# Status Dashboard
  This one is for the possibility of community interactivity in the future. I want to have visualizations of how complete the catalog is. For example, a pie chart showing how many areas in Studios are complete.
