# Universal Playlists Catalog

A simple web project to catalog the background music playlists at Universal Studios Florida.

## MVP Goal

- Start with the **New York** area.
- Display a list of songs (artist + title) in a basic web page.
- All data can be hard-coded at first.

## Why this exists

I work at Universal and I've noticed there’s no good public repository of these playlists. This project is my way of:
- practicing web development
- creating something I can show to others
- building toward a tech career
